Learning curves are an effective method of determining how to optimize model
##############################################################################
- Plot trained cost of model -vs- # of data to train over -> determe whether a model is suffering from bias or variance.
    Test Error and Train Error similar -> Bias, look for more features
    Test Error >> Train Error -> Variance, look for more data
- Plot cost/accuracy of model -vs- different values of hyper parameters
    - Learning rate
    - Training epochs
    - Batch sizes (?)
    - Hidden Layers + nodes
    - Activation functions
    - Hypothesis functions
    - Cost functions (plot vs accuracy)
