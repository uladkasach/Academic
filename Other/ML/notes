Graph Mining

- Community Detection
- Link Prediction
- Vertx Labeling
- Centrality Analysis
    - how important is a given vertex 
    - centrality ~= importance
    - Different kinds of centrality
        - degree centrality
        - distrance centrality
        - betweenness centrality
            - fraction of shortest path that goes throug htaht vertex
            - came from real life understanding, e.g., panama canal is important even though it does not have many conncetions between connecting two communitiesf
        - eigenvector centrality
            - similar to random walk probability
    - Approximate solution is usually required due to large ammount of nodes / verticies
- Random walk on graphs
    - computes probablility  of being at a vertex
    - probability is directly proportional to (# of degrees of node)/(sum of degrees in graph)
    - Page rank finds authority of pages based on random walks of graph
        - since this approximates the percentage of degrees / total degrees on internet per page
- Frequent subgraph mining
